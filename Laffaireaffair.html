                                            <p>Events are well-organised chaos!
                                                <br>
For as long as I can remember, events have held a magnetic pull on me. Conferences,
weddings, fashion shows, award ceremonies – the thrill of the organised chaos, the energy of a
crowd coming together for a shared experience – it all filled me with a strange kind of
excitement. But it wasn't just about attending these events; a deeper yearning resided within
me, a desire to be part of the team that brought them to life. There's a special kind of
satisfaction, I realised, that comes from contributing to the creation of something bigger than
yourself, of witnessing the meticulous planning transform into a vibrant reality.</p>
                                            <p>This yearning finally found an outlet when I, along with my batchmates, volunteered at the
Godrej L'affaire 2024. This wasn't your average event. Godrej L'affaire 2024, held under the
simple yet powerful mantra "Conversations. Communities. Collaboration," was a celebration of
"All Things Goodness." Encompassing eight distinct zones – Lifestyle, Awareness, Fashion,
Flavour, Artistry, Innovation, Rejuvenation, and Environment – the event promised a sensory
experience that embodied the spirit of its theme.</p>
 <p>Stepping into the world of event management, however, was initially daunting. I remember the
time we sat in the briefing room with Zeba Kazi, a senior executive at the Godrej Group. I was
very nervous and scared about how I would manage my task. But as she outlined the event's
goals and our roles within it, my nervousness melted away, replaced by a burgeoning
excitement. We were about to be a part of something special. P.S. Zeba was such a lively
person with infectious energy.

                                        </div>
                                        <div class="col-sm-6 about-text">
                                           
                                            <p>The task allocations were a little here and there. To be honest we were a bit confused at the
start of the event about what we were actually supposed to do since we were briefed on three
different tasks with three different people. But once the event started things and tasks started to
fall into place making us function into full fledged working. I think that’s how events work!
</p>
                                            <p>One of my primary responsibilities involved content creation. Identifying celebrities and
influencers, interacting with them was initially nerve-wracking then became the most fun and
interesting part. Learning to navigate these interactions – some brief and courteous, others
more in-depth – proved to be a valuable lesson in social agility.

</p> <p>But the most significant takeaway from this experience wasn't limited to influencer interaction or
content creation. It was witnessing, obviously not at a full scale, the intricate web of planning
and coordination that goes into crafting a large-scale event. Prior to volunteering, I'd only ever
seen the finished product – the dazzling lights, the captivating performances, the seamless flow
of activities. Now, I had a privileged glimpse behind the scenes, witnessing the tireless efforts
and meticulous planning that ensured everything ran like clockwork. It was an eye-opening
revelation of the dedication required to pull off such a magnificent feat.

its purest form. Even after working tirelessly, their faces remained stamped with vibrant smiles, a
testament to their unwavering passion for the event. Their enthusiasm was contagious, further
solidifying my own desire to be part of this world.
